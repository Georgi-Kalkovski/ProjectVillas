# üè† Project Villas


 Try the site ‚ûú [Vili Neli](https://vilineli.com/ "ViliNeli]")
 
A site site for advertising villas. It is entirely in Bulgarian. The site has `Home` (–ù–∞—á–∞–ª–æ), `Location` (–ú–µ—Å—Ç–æ–ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ), `Gallery` (–ì–∞–ª–µ—Ä–∏—è), `Prices` (–¶–µ–Ω–∏), `Booking` (–†–µ–∑–µ—Ä–≤–∞—Ü–∏—è) and `Contacts` (–ö–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–∫—Ç–∏) pages.

I used [Superhosting.bg](https://www.superhosting.bg/ "Superhosting.bg") for the host and the domain of the project.

Used `Google Maps` and `Google Calendar`, embedding them with iframe.

I also used `FsLightbox` plugin for the Gallery.
